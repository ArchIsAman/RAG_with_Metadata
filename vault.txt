The mission of IIT Bombay is to create an ambiance in which new ideas, research and scholarship flourish and from which the leaders and innovators of tomorrow emerge. IIT Bombay on an average an nually admits more than 1000 candidates for the undergraduate programmes (B.Tech./ Dual Degree and B.S.) through the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), more than 30 candidates for B.Des.Programme through the Undergraduate Common Entrance Exam for Design (U CEED), around 300 candidates for the M.Sc.and the M.Sc.Ph.D.Dual Degree pro- grammes, more than 1000 candidates for postgraduate programmes and around 300 candidates for Ph.D.programmes.IIT Bombay follows a credit -based semester system.There are two se- mesters in an academic year (Autumn: July - Nov; and Spring: January -April) during which all courses specified for various degree programmes are offered.There is one additional term dur- ing summer, called the Summer Term, for summer courses.
Students are re quired to meet spec- ified academic requirements each semester. This booklet provides comprehensive information on the Rules and Regulations for B.Tech., Dual Degree, B.S.and B.Des.Programmes.IIT Bombay gives freedom to its various academic units to tailo r their academic programmes as per their specific needs, within the frame work of the Rules and Regulations approved by the Senate from time to time.Keeping in view the new technical developments and to allow stu- dents some freedom to explore topics of the ir interest, IIT Bombay revised its Undergraduate Programmes curriculum (w.e.f.the Academic Year 2013).The revised curriculum, provides ad- ditional opportunities and flexibility for students to optimize their learning experience.This needs continuous and meticulous planning of the academic profile on the part of each student to fully utilize the opportunities.
The students, and parents/ guardians, are therefore, advised in their own interest to get fully familiar with the Academic system of the Institute. Student’s at- tention is brought particularly to the assessment procedures and the specific rules governing the grading system, academic performance requirements etc.IIT Bombay offers its students best opportunities that are needed to create outstanding sc ien- tists and engineers.We hope that you will strive hard to utilize the resources available to fully develop your potential as an engineer/ scientist/ designer /economist/ social scientist.We wish all our students a very bright future and a successful ca reer.Dean of Academic Programmes 7 Move to Index 1.INTRODUCTION The B.Tech./ Dual Degree/ B.S.programmes consist of courses in basic sciences, humanities and social sciences, engineering and technology and other related topics.The sequence of studies broadly consis ts of three phases.
The first phase is an intense study of sciences, mathematics and humanities for deeper understand- ing of concepts than what was done in school. The second phase is the study of engineering sciences and technical arts (such as workshop, engi- neering graphics, etc.).This study imparts broad based knowledge in general engineering, and en- gineering methodologies, and enables the students to appreciate the links between science and engineering.This phase is also, by and large, common across UG programmes, and overlaps with the first phase.In the third phase, the students are exposed to subjects in their chosen areas of study, designed to train them in the methodologies of analysis of problems and synthesis of solutions.The courses cover the principles governing systems and processes, and develop the ability for physical and ana- lytical modeling, design and development.
They are also introduced to engineering practices through laboratory courses, projects, etc., and these vary from discipline to discipline. In parallel with the third phase, students can strive to broaden their perspectives through atleast two open Institute electives where they can take courses drawn from across the Institute.B.S.programme students, in addition, work independently on a project in their last two semesters.Dual Degree students do additional courses to get in -depth knowledge in their chosen disciplines, often with specializations.In addition, they work on a research and dev elopment project during their final year.At various stages of the programme, students are initiated into research methodologies, reading and interpreting research papers, use of engineering and scientific equipments/ instruments, mod- ern computational tech niques, writing technical and scientific reports and effective communication.
Apart from the minimum credit requirements for the award of the degree, opportunities exist for supplementing the learning experience by crediting additional courses, in diverse areas. These ad- ditional credits, when they are in focused areas, can earn the students’ credentials like Minor/ Hon- ours.The requirements for degree programmes run by the Institute are broadly classified as: a) Institute Requirements (further divided into Com pulsory courses, Elective courses and other requirements).b) Departmental Requirements (further divided into Compulsory courses, Elective courses and other requirements).The curriculum for various programmes are available on the Institute website: www.iitb.ac.in 8 Move to Index 1.1 Organizational Structure for Academic Administration The academic programmes of the Institute are governed by Rules and Regulations approved by the Senate from time to time.
The Senate is a statutory and supreme body that governs all academic matters of the Institute, and the rulings of Senate Chairperson (Director of The Institut e) are final in regard to all academic issues. A definite time schedule is set by the Senate for various academic activities, through an Academic Calendar issued at the beginning of each academic year.The Senate continuously assesses the academic program mes and makes appropriate revisions/ modifications/ improvements as and when required through two Institute level Senate sub -com- mittees: The Undergraduate Programmes Committee (UGPC) for undergraduate programmes and a Post - Graduate Programmes Committee (P GPC) for post -graduate programmes.The Dean of Ac- ademic Programmes (Dean, AP) and the Associate Dean of Academic Programmes (Associate Dean, AP) are the Conveners & Co -conveners respectively of these committees.
Similarly, the performance and evaluation r elated issues are monitored by the Senate through two Institute level committees: Undergraduate Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (UGAPEC) and Postgraduate Academic Performance Evaluation Committee (PGAPEC). Conveners for these committees are desig nated from among Senate members.These four committees make recommen- dations to the Senate and in turn seek/ receive opinions/ recommendations, when required, from the two Department level committees in each department, the Department Undergraduate Com- mitte e (DUGC) and the Department Postgraduate Committee (DPGC).The DUGCs and DPGCs handle all academic matters, related to both academic programmes as well as performance of individual student.The Head of the Department is the convener of both these departmen tal committees.The Senate as well as its sub -committees also have student representatives.
Administrative backup for all academic matters is provided by the Academic Office, with a Joint/ Deputy Registrar (Academic) as in -charge. On joining the Institute, each student is assigned a Faculty Adviser from his/her Department.Stu- dents must consult the Faculty Adviser on any matter relating to their academic performance and the courses they may take in various semesters/ summer terms.The Faculty Adviser guides the students to complete their courses of study for the required degree in a timely manner, while main- taining good academic performance.All academic issues connected with the B.Tech., Dual degree, B.S.and B.Des.programmes are han- dled by DUGC, UGAPEC a nd UGPC.If on any academic matter a student would like to approach this administrative structure, it is always through the DUGC with advice and recommendations from her /his Faculty Adviser.
9 Move to Index Organizational structure for Academic Matters 1.2 Academic Calendar The academic activities of the Institute are regulated by the Academic Calendar approved by the Senate, and released at the beginning of each academic year. It is mandatory for students / faculty to strictly adhere to the academic calend ar for completion of academic activities.The Academic Calendar can be seen on the Academic Office website of the Institute: (http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/toacadcalender.jsp ) 1.3 Conduct of classes for first year UG students (Ref.256th Senate Meeting) a) Lectures to be held ONLY between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm and only on working days.b) No extra/compensatory lectures to be conducted on weekends in general.The lectures which are misse d due to an Institute holiday, may be covered up on a weekend, preferably on Saturday.2 CURRICULUM / PROGRAMME OF STUDY 2.1 Curriculum Every Department has a prescribed course structure which, is known as the Curriculum.
It prescribes the courses, labs an d other requirements for award of the degree and sets out the nominal se- quence semester -wise. It also gives the syllabus and a list of texts and reference books for each course.The Curriculum details are updated every semester and are made available at th e Institute website.2.2 Semester – Autumn, Spring, Summer The Institute follows a credit -based semester system.There are two regular semesters in a year.The semester that begins in July (July to Nov.) is known as the Autumn Semester or Semester 1 and the semester that begins in January (Jan.to April/May) is known as the Spring Semester or Semester 2.During the summer vacation, i.e., (May -June), a few courses are offered as part of Summer Term (refer Sec.4.8).These courses can be taken by students as per summer term guidelines.
10 Move to Index 2.3 Course Credit Structure In general, a certain quantum of academic work measured in terms of credits is laid down as the requirement for a particular degree. A student earns credits by satisfactorily clearing courses/ other academic activities every semester.The credits associated with a course/ other academic activity are dependent on the number of hours of work expected to be put in by the student per week.2.3.1 Theory and Laboratory Courses Courses are broadly classified as Theory Courses and Laboratory Courses .Theory courses consist of lecture ( L) and tutorial ( T) hours, but may have attached practical ( P) hours in special cases.Labor- atory courses consist of practical hours, but may have attached tutorial hours in special cases.Credit (C) for a course is obtained by multiplying the number of hours of instruction per week in that course, by two ( 2) for lecture and tutorial hours, and by one (1) for laboratory hours i.e.C = 2xL + 2xT + P .
A student is expected to sp end, on average, one hour every week outside class for every lecture/ tutorial held that week. Two examples of credit calculation are shown below: Theory Courses Laboratory Courses L T P C L T P C 2 1 0 6 0 1 3 5 In the Courses of Study, if a theory course is shown as, say, CE304 Soil Mechanics II: 2 1 0 6 , it means that CE304 is the course code, Soil Mechanics II is the course title and 2 1 0 6 corresponds to L T P C respectively.Other academic activities consist of a Seminar, Projects, which carry credits and NSO/ NSS/ NCC, in which only a pass (PP) or no -pass (NP) grades are awarded.2.3.2 Course Equivalence ( Ref: 251st Senate Meeting) : Addition of course equivalence for core courses will be permitted on approval of DUGC of respective Academic Units.2.3.3 Seminars Some departments prescribe a Seminar as a requirement for B.Tech./ B.S./ B.Des.or the Dual De- gree.
A Seminar is a course wherein under the guidance of a faculty member a student is expected to do an in -depth study in a specialized area by doing a survey of published technical literature and understand different aspects of the problem. Finally, the results from l iterature must be summa- rized in a written report and presented before a designated committee of faculty members.Semi- nars typically carry 3 credits .2.3.4 Projects 2.3.4.1 B.Tech.Projects (BTP - I and BTP – II) Some departments prescribe Project as a requ irement for the B.Tech.degree, or as a requirement for Honours (refer Sec.2.5.2), wherein under the guidance of a faculty member a student, in the 11 Move to Index sixth semester or later, is required to do innovative work with the application of knowledge gained from cou rses in the earlier years.The student is expected to do a survey of literature in the subject, work out a project plan and carry it out through design, analysis, experimentation etc.
These pro- jects (BTPs) may be offered as a single unit of 12 credits (BTP ) or as 6 credits of BTP -I followed by BTP-II of 6 credits or 12 credits. (Ref: 241st Senate Meeting) Even when it is not prescribed as a minimum requirement for the degree or when not being inter- ested in Honours, a student can opt to do a BTP as additional learning, if s/he can find suitable supervisor (s) to guide her/him.2.3.4.2 B.S.Project (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting) Some departments prescribe a B.S.Project as a requirement for the B.S.degree.Such a project is carried out under the guidel ines of a faculty member and may carry 6 or more credits as prescribed by the department.2.3.4.3 Dual Degree Project (DDP) The Dual Degree Project is a mandatory requirement of the Dual Degree Programmes.The project consists of two stages, spread over fourteen months, normally starting from the summer after the eighth semester and ending with the summer after the tenth semester.
These are essentially re- search and development projects, where a student trains under the guidance of supervisor/ s, in - depth analysis of an engineering problem and attempts synthesis of a solution. Literature survey, problem analysis and problem definition, extensive experimental/ modeling/ computational work and analysis of results typically form various components of the proje ct work.A DDP (B.Tech.- M.Tech.) carries a total of 72 credits .2.3.4 Non -Credit Requirements 2.3.4.1 NCC / NSO / NSS One of the three activities, National Cadet Corps (NCC) or National Sports Organization (NSO) or National Service Scheme (NSS) is a mandat ory requirement for all students for the award of a degree.These are normally conducted during evenings of week days and are designed to build character and to sensitize the students to social/ national issues.These activities carry no credits and are evaluated as Pass (PP)/ Not Pass (NP) .
2.4 Minimum Credit Requirements and Planning of Individual Academic Programme (Ref: 233rd Senate Meeting) Depending on the discipline, the minimum credits required for the award of a B.Tech. / B.S./ B.Des.degree are between 266 and 282 (till 2021 batch), though the department component can be dif- ferently designed by the departments.This is nominally divided into Basic Sciences (60 to 62), Engineering Sciences & skills (30), HSS Elec- tives (12), Institute Electives (1 2), Departmental courses (152 to 168).The "B.Tech.+ M.Tech.Dual Degree programme" should have all of the following components over and above the corresponding basic B.Tech.curriculum: 12 Move to Index a) B.Tech Honours credit a minimum of 24 credits that can comprise of e ither only courses or a combination of courses and a Project.The Project duration can be of two semesters with a maximum of 18 credits.b) 24 credits consisting of four masters level courses.
c) 72 credits of a masters' thesis spread over 14 months (e.g. summe r between eighth and ninth semester, plus ninth and tenth semesters).The credits are distributed semester -wise as shown in the Courses of Study bulletin for each department.Courses generally progress in sequences, building competencies and their position ing indicates certain academic ma- turity on the part of the students.Some courses do, in addition, specify passing in courses offered earlier in the programmes as pre -requisites.Students are expected to follow the semester -wise schedule of courses given i n the Courses of Study bulletin; they do, however, have freedom to follow alternative schedules to optimize their academic profile with addi- tional courses, keeping the requirements for each course in mind.For students who may have dropped mandatory course s, such rescheduling may even become necessary.
Such departures from suggested schedules need to be done very carefully, and always with ap- proval of the Faculty Adviser. d) In addition to the DD requirements, if a student completes 24.0 credits towards the ho nors of the parent department, then he/ she will be considered for award of B.Tech./ B.S.with honors of the parent department subject to the recommendation of DUGC of the parent department (2021 batch onwards).2.5 Opportunities for Additional Learning: MINOR, HONOURS, ETC.: The B.Tech./ Dual Degree/ B.S.programmes recognize the fact that students’ aspirations and the demands of the work place, have become highly diverse.Every student has specific abilities, inter- ests and career goals.Each p rogramme prescribes the minimum credits and courses that qualify a candidate for the award of the Degree in a particular discipline.The total credits for the B.Tech.Programme, for example, vary between 266 -282 (till 2021 batch) depending on the disciplin e, as mentioned earlier.
This ap- proximately converts itself into about four theory courses and one or two laboratory courses or other activities like seminar, project, etc., every semester. The curriculum is designed to permit B.Tech., B.S.and B.Des.stu dents, who are not identified as academically weak, to optionally take additional courses.The freedom to take about six credits every semester after the first year, permits a student to satisfy her/his interests / abilities and aspi- rations.It is expected that all students with reasonably good academic standing, utilize this surplus time for enhancing their academic learning experience, though the initiative is left entirely to them.They can use it to credit an assortment of courses/projects anywhere in the Institute, (subject to require- ments of each of these courses being met), to gain a wide exposure.These additional academic accomplishments will find a separate mention in the transcript (refer Sec.6.8.4) .
They can also credit courses in s pecific areas which can qualify as a minor/ honours. They may alternatively devote part 13 Move to Index or all of the additional time for extra - curricular activities (including social work) if they so desire, and gain hands -on administrative/ managerial/ aesthetic skills or sensitivity towards social issues.Since seats available in such additional courses are often limited and the competition severe, stu- dents aspiring to do these additional courses have to maintain high academic standing to register in these courses.2.5.1 Minor Minor is an additional credential a student may earn if s/he does 30 credits worth of additional courses in a discipline other than her/his major discipline of B.Tech.degree.All academic units in the Institute offer minors in their disciplines , and will prescribe a specific set of courses and/or pro- jects necessary for earning a minor in that discipline.
A student must pre -register for a minor course which is finally allotted on the basis of highest CPI. S/he accumulates credits by registering f or the required courses, and if the requirements for a par- ticular minor are met within the prescribed minimum time limit for the programme, the minor will be awarded.This will be mentioned in the Degree Certificate as “Bachelor of Technology in xxx with Minor in yyy.” This will also be reflected in the transcript, along with the list of courses taken.Since the number of seats available for each of the courses are often limited, one has to compete for a place in every course.If 30 credits are not complete d for Minor then Minor will not be awarded .The individual course credits earned, however, will be reflected in the transcript.For the award of the minor, all requirements towards the basic degree and the minor have to be completed within the stipulated period of the programme one is registered for.
The Senate in its 224th meeting approved the proposal of allowing Dual Degree stud ents to under- take minor courses. These rules were further modified in the 236th meeting of the Senate.DD students of category I and II can register for minor courses from 2nd year onwards.These stu- dents are allowed to take additional courses (within per missible credit limit) in their 9th and 10th Semesters, if needed to complete the minor requirement.(Ref: 239th Senate Meeting) 2.5.2 Honours Honours is an additional credential a student may earn if s/he opts for the extra 24 credits needed for this in her/his own discipline.The concerned department specifies the set of courses for earning Honours.Honours is not indicative of class.Students can acc umulate credits by registering for Honours courses prescribed by the department.
On successful accumulation of 24 credits at the end of the programme, this will be mentioned in the Degree Certificate as “Bachelor of Technology in xxx, with Honours.” This w ill also be reflected in the transcript, along with the list of courses taken. For the award of the honours to B.Tech.students, all requirements towards the basic degree and the honours have to be completed within the stipulated period of the programme on e is registered for.14 Move to Index Dual degrees of B.Tech.and M.Tech.intrinsically demand a deeper expertise in the major discipline of the student, and therefore Dual Degree students are required to complete the requirements for Honours, as prescribed by the departme nt.The requirements for Honours for a Dual Degree student may be different from those prescribed for a B.Tech.student.This requirement is over and above the basic requirements for the B.Tech.degrees as prescribed by each department.
The total credit requirement (till 2021 batch) is therefore 266 -282 (B.Tech.) + 24 (Honours) + 72 (Project) + 24 (Mas- ters courses) . 2.5.3 More than one minor for students (Ref: 259th Senate Meeting) Students can opt for earning additional minor/s (i.e.an Honour and a minor, OR if time table permits, two or more minors).Students should discuss this with their faculty advisers since completing more than one minor would involve significant overload.2.6 Amalgamation of Half Semester courses into one for 1st year of UG progra mme (Ref.256th Senate Meeting) Two half semester courses to be taught as one full semester course for 1st year of UG programme, awarding only one grade at the end of the semester.Courses should be taught in a seamless way with summative evaluation at the end.3.ROLE OF THE FACULTY ADVISER On joining the Institute, a student or a group of students is/are assigned to a Faculty Adviser.
The students are expected to consult the Faculty Adviser on any matter relating to their academic per- formance and the cour ses they may take in various semesters. The Faculty Adviser guides the stu- dents to complete their courses of study for the required degree.For effective utilization of the opportunities for additional academic accomplishments, the planning of an individua l’s academic journey needs careful consideration, and hence constant consultation with the Faculty Advisers are imperative.The Faculty Adviser is the person whom the parents/ guardians should contact for per- formance related issues of their wards.The rol e of the Faculty Adviser is outlined below: a) Guide the students about the rules and regulations governing the courses of study.b) Advise the students to register for courses as per the curriculum and their academic stand- ing.c) Approve the registration of the students.
d) Pay special attention to weak students and carefully monitor the performance of students recommended for the slow track option. e) Advice students on Course Adjustment / Drop during the Semester within the stipulated time frame given in the Academic calendar.f) Advice students seeking a semester drop about rules and regulations laid down for this pur- pose and recommend these cases to the UGAPEC through the DUGC, for consideration.15 Move to Index g) Consider and recommend to the DUGC, appl ications for course/ credit requirements for the students for exchange programmes.In addition, the faculty adviser converts the grades from the foreign institute to IIT Bombay as per senate approved rules.h) To ensure that students are not permitted to re -register for courses, which they have al- ready passed.i) Inform students that grades will not be awarded for any academic activity (course/ Lab./ seminar/ project/ non -credit requirement etc.) without approved registration.
j) Strictly warn students that if s/he fails to register during any semester without prior ap- proval, his/her studentship is liable to be cancelled. 4.REGISTRATION Registration at the beginning of each semester, as per the prescribed dates announced in the Aca- demic Calendar, is mandatory for every student till s/he completes her/ his programme.If a student does not register in a particular semester without prior permission of the UGAPEC, her/his student- ship is liable to be cancelled .Students are not permitted to re -register for course/(s), which they have already passed.All students’ registration has to be approved by his/ her faculty Adviser.Some courses may also require instructor consent.4.1 Semester -Wise registration On joining the Institute, each student is assigned to a Faculty Adv iser or an Advisory group (refer Sec.3).
The student can register for courses s/he intends to take during a given semester or summer term on the basis of the programme for each discipline as given in the Curriculum and as per the advice given by his/her Fa culty Adviser. The Faculty Adviser is expected to discuss with the student his/her academic performance during the previous semester and then decide the number and na- ture of the courses for which s/he can register during the semester within the framework o f the guidelines as approved by the Senate.The Faculty Adviser may advise the student to drop one or more courses/ activities based on his/her academic performance (refer Sec.5.1).In fact, the Faculty Adviser may even advise a reduced load programme ove r several semesters for students with poor performance at the end of the first semester/ year.4.2 Procedure for Registrations The Institute has an online registration system and the registration is normally done on the first two days of each semester.
The registration schedule is announced in the Academic Calendar. In all cir- cumstances, registration must be completed on or before the prescribed last date for registration.Students having outstanding dues to the Institute or a hostel shall not be permitted to register.4.2.1 Online Registration The online registration process involves filling up of an online Course Registration Form (CRF) stating the courses and project / seminar etc., that the student proposes to complete during that semester as per the prescribed curriculum.This should be done in consultation with the Faculty Adviser, who finally approves the registration as per permissible load (refer Sec.5.2).Grades will not be awarded for any academic activity (course/ Lab./ seminar/ project/ non -credit requirement etc.) without ap- proved r egistration.
16 Move to Index 4.2.2 Late Registration Only for valid reasons, late registration may be permitted till the date specified in the Academic Calendar, on payment of a late registration fee. 4.2.3 Registration for the first two semesters (except B.Des.) In each of the first two semesters, courses common to all branches are generally offered.A student is normally required to register for all the courses listed in the curriculum for these two semesters.Students, who are identified as academically weak at the end of first semester, may be prescribed a reduced load (refer Sec.10).4.2.4 Registration for third and subsequent semesters The prescribed credits per semester is given in the course bulletin of the respective academic units.From the third semester on wards, registration is dependent on the academic standing of the stu- dent.
A student with an academic standing of Category I, II, III and IV may register for additional courses over and above the prescribed credits in the course bulletin with the approval o f Faculty Adviser subject to Section 5.2. 4.3 Registration for Institute Elective Courses: An Institute Elective course can be any credit course across the Institute provided that: a) It should not be from the Academic Unit in which the student is registered.b) It should not be ‘Core’ or ‘Department Elective’ course in the curriculum on the programme in which the student is registered.An Institute Elective course should be registered in consultation of Faculty Advisor.4.4 Registration for Non -credi t courses (NCC/ NSO / NSS) Non -credit requirements are assessed as Pass (PP)/ Not Pass (NP) subject to the fulfillment of the minimum requirements of these activities and a minimum of 80% attendance.One of NCC, NSO or NSS, is a mandatory requirement for the award of degree.
Students are expected to complete these requirements during the first year (first two semesters). Formal registration for any one of these activities must be done along with other courses, at the beginning in the first two semesters.The choice of the activity will be done on the basis of the aptitude of the student for any one of these activities and will be decided by a committee constituted for the purpose.Once registered for one of these activities, no change will be permitted at a later stage.In addition to the above mandatory requirements, the students are permitted to take NSS/NSO/NCC in subsequent years too, if they have special interest.This will be mentioned in the transcript (refer Sec.6.8.4) 4.5 Registration for Projects 4.5.1 Registration for B.Tech.Projects (BTPs): Registration for B.Tech.Projects (BTPs) as specified in the curriculum, is similar to that for any other course.The details of allotment of topics, faculty supervisors etc.
are specified by the concerned department before the commencement of the semester. 17 Move to Index 4.5.2 Registration for Dual Degree Projects (DDPs) a) The total duration for the DDP is fourteen months.DDP consists of two stages.Credits for Stage I are 30 -36 and for stage II are 36 to 42.
The informatio n about project registration, presentation/ submission/ assessment and submission of grades is given below: Project Stage Registration Submission/Presentation/As- sessment to be completed during the following period Submission of Grades to the Academic Offic e on or before Stage I Registration for stage I will be done in January (8th Semester) – As per aca- demic calendar By October Month (9th Semes- ter)– As per academic calendar October/ November of the same year (9th Se- mester) – As per aca- demic calendar (Final) Stage II Registration for stage II will be carried out along with the grade report for the stage I – As per aca- demic calendar By June Month (Just after 10th Semester) – As per academic calendar July of the same year (Just after 10th Semes- ter)– As per academic calendar b) Each Dual Degree student should have a member of the faculty as a supervisor.
In addition, Co-supervisor/(s) from the same Department/ other Department / IDP Group/Centre / School may be co -opted by the supervisor with the approval of the DUGC. If the supervisor is not from the same department as the student, a co -supervisor from the Department is necessary.c) Whenever a supervisor leaves the Institute permanently/ temporarily, the DUGC shall make alternative arrangements for guidance during the supervisor’s absence.Requirements for the DDP and the evaluation procedures are given in (refer Sec.6.4.2) 4.5.3 Registration for B.S.Project (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting) Registration for B.S.Projects as specified in the curriculum, is similar to that for any other course.The details of allotment of topics, faculty supervisors etc.are specified by the concerned depart- ment before the commencement of the semester.
4.6 Course Adjustment/ Dropping of courses a) The Academic Calendar sets a date, typically one week after the commencement of the semester, for Course Adjustment. On or before this date, a student is permitted to make adjustments in her/his academic load by addition or deletion of one or more courses, pro- jects etc., provided the total credits do not exceed the bounds (refer Sec.5.2).Course ad- justment has to be done in consultation with the Faculty Adviser.b) If in the second or any of the subsequent semesters, a stud ent finds her/his academic load too heavy, s/he may drop some courses in consultation with the Faculty Advise r, provided 18 Move to Index the minimum credit requirements ( 18 credits ) are fulfilled.The last date for such drops is typically 20 -30 days after the end of the mid-semester examination, and is set in the Aca- demic Calendar.It is expected that the results of the mid -semester examination will be known within seven days of the end of the examination.
4.7 Dropping of a Semester: a) A student may opt/be advised to drop an entire semester, with prior approval of DUGC/UGAPEC due to the following reasons: i. During a registered semester, if a student finds that s/he is unable to cope up with the studies and/or does not have sufficient exposure to most of the courses registered in that semester due to severe health problem or some other valid reasons beyond her/his control, s/he can opt to drop the entire semester, in consultation with the Faculty Ad- viser and with permission from the DUGC/UGAPEC.ii.A student may seek a semester dr op, due to severe personal health problem, unavoid- able family commitments or other valid reasons beyond her/his control, in consultation with the Faculty Adviser and with permission from the DUGC/UGAPEC, prior to the com- mencement of the semester itself.b) In all cases of severe health problems, medical certificate issued by IIT Hospital is essential.
If however, the medical certificate is issued by other hospitals/private practitioners, the cer- tificates should be duly authenticated by the CMO, IIT Hospital. I n all other cases, requests for dropping the semester should be accompanied by supporting documents as required.c) A student will be not permitted to drop a semester after the award of DX/ II grade/(s) and/ or semester end examination.d) Such breaks from studi es is typically not permitted for a continuous period in excess of one year.e) Not registering for any semester before the last date for registration without prior approval of the UGAPEC may result in the UGAPEC recommending dropping that semester.(Ref: 240th Senate meeting) f) Hostel accommodation and other institutional facilities will not be extended in any semes- ter for which the student has not registered.4.8 Registration for Additional Courses (Minor, Honours etc.): (Ref.
- 236th Senate Meeting) Any student may register for minor or Honours courses subject to satisfying the pre -requisites for the respective courses. The number of students permitted for Minor courses is to be specified be- fore the registration date by the department, and the allocat ion is done on the basis of CPI .Students are permitted to register for Minor courses only during the pre - registration period .Note that there is no specific registration for Honours Courses.One accumulates the required cred- its during the course of the programme and the additional credential is awarded if the criteria set for them are met when the student graduates.19 Move to Index In any semester, a student must register for at least one course component that is specified as the minimum requirement of the degree.Moreover, a student cannot overstay in the programme once the minimum requirements prescribed for the basic degree are completed.
4.9 Summer term Course Registration: Running of courses in summer term and registration of students to these courses must fol low the guidelines mentioned below: a) The course instructor/(s) should be willing to offer the course. The DUGC should rec- ommend offering of such a summer course for consideration and approval of the Dean of Academic Programmes.The course is offered on approval of the Dean of Academic Programmes.b) The course should be offered with adequate rigor and in the same manner as a regular se- mester course is offered.The registration, examination and assessment, course duration and grading should adhere to the timelines in academic calendar.The total number of con- tact hours for the courses remains the same as that during the regular semesters, and there- fore, the courses run at accelerated pace (for ex ample 6 hours of instructions per week is expected for a 3 -0-0 course) the Academic Calendar in this connection is strictly followed.
c) The dropping of a Summer Course is permitted within 7 days from the first lecture of the course. Fee is not refundable.d) Re-exam is permitted on the same terms and conditions like that of regular semester courses.e) Time slots will be assigned by or communicated to the Academic Office like that of regular semester courses.f) A student can take up to a maximum of 24 credits of Mandatory Courses (Core + HSS + Department & Institute Electives) in which s/he has received FR/DX/DR/W grade.However, if a student accumulates two (or more) “FR” in Mandatory Courses and does not find enough courses (totaling up to 24 credits) in a summer term, s/he can take a maximum of two Mandatory Courses in which s/he has NEVER registered.(Ref: 239th Senate Meeting - effective from Summer term 2019 -20).g) Courses requiring pre -requisites need instructor’s approval in case the student has not completed the pre -requisites.(Ref: 239th Senate Meeting - effective from Summer term 2019 -20).
h) NO restrictions (i.e. #f) will apply after the expiry of the regular programme duration (4 years for B .Tech, B.Des.and B.S., 5 years for DD).(Ref:239th Senate Meeting - effective from Summer term 2019 -20).i) At least 05 students should register for the summer course.The attendance record should be maintained and the minimum of 80% attendance is compulsory.The Instructors may award a “FR” grade to students who fail to adhere to 80% attendance for the summer course.20 Move to Index j) Courses offered in a summer term will be treated as equivalent to regular semester courses for all accounting purposes.4.10.Minimum Number of Students Required to Run a Particular Course (Ref: 229th Senate Meeting) A minimum of 5 students s hould be registered in a course to be run as a Department/ Institute Elective course.If less than 5 students are re gistered at any given point of time, the concerned DUGC/ Head of Academic Units may decide to run a course.
E ven a single (1) student is registered for a 'Minor' co urse, the course is required to be offered. 5.SPECIAL FEATURES IN REGISTRATION The curr iculum has special features that a student must be aware of while registering for courses.These include institute core courses, department core and elective courses, non -departmental courses, minor and honours options.Registration for courses depend on t he academic standing of the student, as explained in this section.The registration for backlog courses and audit courses are also explained in this section.5.1 Academic Standing (Ref: 236th Senate Meeting) Depending on the overall academic performance of a student till date, especially in the two preced- ing regular semesters (Autumn and Spring) in which the student had registered, the academic stand- ing of the student is decided.A NP (not passed) grade is not counted towards failed courses in the context of determining the academic standing.
Categorization of the academic standing of a student is as follows: Category I: A student who has CPI at least 8, and no outstanding FR/DX/DR/W grade in a core cou rse. Category II: CPI less than 8, and no outstanding FR/DX/DR/W grade in a core course .Category III (Ref: 241st Senate Meeting) : A student who has at least one outstanding FR/DX/DR/W in core courses and at most one FR or DX grade in any other course in two preceding regular regis- tered semesters, subject to having earned at least 18 credits in each of the semesters.These 18 credits may be earned in courses with any TAG.Category IV (Ref: 241st Senate Meeting) : A stu dent who has at least one outstanding FR/DX/DR/W in core courses and more than one FR or DX grade in any other course in two preceding regular registered semesters, subject to having earned at least 18 credits in each of the semesters.These 18 credits may be earned in courses with any TAG.
Category V: A student who has not earned at least 18 credits (in courses with any TAG) in at least one of the previous two regular registered semesters. Category VI (ARP): Students who have accumulated FRs/DXs worth 36 credits in core courses.Note: a) Category VI supersedes all other categories.b) Students in the 8th Semester for B.Tech ./B.S.and 10th Semester for DD programmes may 21 Move to Index register for upto 54 credits on recommendation of the Faculty Adviser/ PIC (ARP ) (Ref: 261st Senate Meeting) In such cases where students have returned from semester exchange and the grades are not up- dated till the time of registration, the performance in the last two completed semesters at IIT Bom- bay may be considered for the purpose of CPI and Academic Category calculation.The same rule is also applicable in cases of semester drop.
(Ref: 237th Senate Meeting) Interim Categories of the students are calculated using the information available 24 hours before registration for the new semester begins. These categori es are used for the purpose of registration for the new semester.(Ref:248th Senate Meeting) 5.2 Permissible Registration Load (Ref: 235th Senate meeting) Students are allowed to register as per their academic standing subject to a maximum credit limit as given below: Academic Standing Maximum Credits Allowed Category I 54 credits Category II, III, IV 48 credits Category V 36 credits (Ref: 261st Senate meeting) Category VI (ARP) 24 credits The Faculty Adviser is the competent authority to approve course registration in all cases.Every student must register for a minimum of 18 credits each semester.In case a student has com- pleted most of the minimum credit requirements, she/he may register for the remaining courses which are available in that seme ster, which may be less than 18 credits.
The maximum credits allowed as given above cannot be exceeded under any circumstances . While these are the maximum allowed credits the Faculty Adviser may prescribe lower credits especially for Category III, IV, V and VI.The Dual Degree project credits will not be counted in case of permissible load.(Ref: 241st Senate Meeting) The current limits on credits (as per the academic category) for registration purposes are applicable only for students who have not yet completed the regular duration of programme for their degree, beyond which the above restriction is waived.(w.e.f.Spring Semester 2020 -21) 5.3 Carrying backlogs forward Attempts are made in the programme to give an early opportunity to register again for courses in which students may have received FR/ W/ DR/ DX grade.a) The Institute core courses are expected to be offered in both the semesters, so that a stu- dent can register for a backlog course in the immediate next semester.
22 Move to Index b) For department core courses that are not possible to be offered in both semesters, the Fac- ulty Adviser may advise the students appropriately for dropping the backlog course in favor of some other course in order to avoid a cascading effect in subsequent semesters. The Faculty Advise rs and DUGCs would exercise special care and assist the students in this re- gard.c) Students should give priority to clear core courses that are pre -requisites for other courses in subsequent semesters.5.4 Audit Course A student wanting just an exposure to a course, without the rigors of obtaining a letter grade, can register a course in 'Audit' mode.A course can be audited provided the course is offered in the semester as a credit course for others, and there is no slot clash.Prior permission of the Instr uctor is required.
To complete a course in 'Audit' mode, the student has to fulfil the requirement as set by the course instructor, such as submission of assignments and minimum performances in in -semester evalua- tions. A course, successfully completed in ' Audit' mode, cannot be considered towards the require- ment of Minor or Honours.A student, on successful completion of the requirements of a course in 'Audit' mode, will be eligible for a 'AU' grade.The 'AU' grade carries zero grade point and is not includ ed in SPI/CPI calculations.The 'AU' grade will be shown in the Transcript.In case a student fails to complete the requirements of a course, registered in 'Audit' mode, instruc- tor will not assign any grade and the student will be de -registered from the co urse.The same will be deleted from the student's registration, as it will be assumed that the course has been dropped by that student.For the entire duration of the programme, a UG student can audit maximum TWO courses.
UG students, who are only in Categ ory I and II, will be permitted to 'Audit' a course during a regular semester. 5.5 Registration for Postgraduate level courses (Ref: 235th Senate Meeting) Undergraduate students may be permitted to register for some postgraduate level courses from fifth semester onwards with permission of the instructor and approval of the Faculty Adviser with- out any restrictions.5.6 Guided Study: (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting) Guided Study is doing courses outside the curriculum in the self -study like mode, during a regula r semester.A student belonging to category I may be provided the option of Guided study to acquire proficiency in an area of his/her choice, on recommendation of the Faculty Adviser/ project guide, DUGC and approval of UGAPEC .Guided Study will be availab le to the extent of a maximum of one course per semester with effect from the third semester, subject to a maximum of four courses in the entire programme .
This option is strictly subject to the availability and willingness of the instruc- tor offering the c ourse . Guided Study and URA (refer Sec.9) will not run concurrently, and the rules 23 Move to Index that govern permissible registration load apply strictly even for these courses.These courses can be considered towards Minor/ Honours , if so specified by the concerned academic unit.Registration, Examination/ Evaluation and submission of grade etc.in case of guided study will also be governed in the similar way as other courses of the curriculum .The option of guided study may also be made available, by the UGAPEC, in the following situation, on a case -by-case basis: Students who miss the ‘Departmental Introductory Course’ due to a change of branch obtained at the end of First year.5.7 Self -Study (Ref: 236th Senate Meeting) Stud ents can take upto two courses as self -study, after the expiry of the regular programme dura- tion (4 years for B.Tech, B.Des, B.S.
Programs, 5 years for Dual Degree) after taking necessary ap- proval. This option is only available for completing the mandatory credits.However, for the self -study option, the following directives will be followed: - a) The registration, examination etc.will be as per academic calendar.The evaluation for self - study will be done in the similar way as is done for normal semester course.b) Academic standards be rigorously maintained in the self -study mode.5.8 Course Substitution In case a student obtains FR/DX grades or drops courses due to valid reason, s/he may like to subst itute courses in order to complete the requirements within the stipulated duration.Following is the guideline for course substitution.a) Course substitution is not permitted for Core Courses, may it be an institute core course or departmental core course.T he student has to re -register the same course and complete them.
b) An Institute elective course may be substituted by another Institute elective course from the same group. c) A departmental elective course may be substituted by another departmental elective co urse from the same group.5.9 Course Attendance Rule  Attendance in classes is mandatory from the very beginning of the semester.Students who miss even a single lecture from among the first three lectures of a course, are liable to have themselves de registered from the corresponding course. The student’s attendance report, with an alert message to be sent to parents/ guardian of all 1st year students.The message should be in bilingual (Hindi and English).It is expected that all students should have 100% attendance in courses.(Ref: 256th Senate M eeting) 6 EXAMINATION / ASSESSMENT Semester wise performance assessment of every registered student is done through various modes of examinations.
These include quizzes, class tests, home assignments, group a ssignments, viva - 24 Move to Index voce, mid -semester examination and semester -end examination. The Instructor will announce the modes of evaluation and distribution of weightage for each of the assessments at the beginning of the course.Various modes of assessment for the ory and laboratory courses along with the recommended rela- tive weightage of various components are given in this section.A large departure from the recom- mended modes of assessments and weightage will require prior approval from the Dean of Aca- demic Progra mmes.6.1 Modes of Evaluation for Theory Courses a) Various modes of assessment used for rating students’ performance in a theory course include quizzes, class tests, home assignments, group assignments, viva -voce, mid -semester and se- mester -end examinations.Relative weightage for in -semester evaluations is typically between 50 and 60 per cent.
This will consist of one mid -semester exam of two hours duration, of about 25-30 per cent weightage, to be held as per the schedule fixed in the Academic Calendar. Two quizzes or one quiz and one test along with assig nments and viva -voce shall make up the rest of the in -semester assessment or as declared by the course instructor at the beginning of the semester The Instructor may also set aside up to a maximum of 20 per cent of the in -semester marks for attendance and/ or class participation.(Ref: 235th Senate Meeting) Make -up for any absence from in -semester evaluations like midsem/tests/quizzes will be at the discretion of the Instructor.b) The semester end examination will be held as per the Academic Calendar and the weightage for this would be typically 40 to 50 per cent.It is typically of 3 hours duration and covers the full syllabus of the course.The semester - end examination is mandatory.
The instructor awards an “II” grade for those students not appearing for th e Semester end examination, if they have not been awarded a DX grade for insufficient attendance. Such students are eligible for a se- mester -end re -examination only on medical grounds/ valid reasons (refer Sec.6.6) and on pro- duction of medical certificate or other supporting documents as the case requires.The appli- cation must be submitted to Instructor concerned before the start date of re -exam and online grading window announced in the Academic Calendar.Instructors are expected to conduct the re-exam and upload the grade as per academic calendar.c) If a student fails to appear for the re -examination too, the instructor will award “FR” grade again.If the absence in the re exam is due to medical / valid reasons, the student must submit supporting documents a s mentioned above, within seven days of the scheduled date of the re - exam, to the Academic Office.
UGAPEC will examine such cases and convert the “II” grade into a dropped course status (“DR”). In all other cases the “II” grade will be converted to “FR” gr ade.In any case the “II” grade will not be continued beyond the commencement of the subsequent semester.6.2 Modes of Evaluation for Laboratory Courses The assessment in a laboratory course will be based on turn -to-turn supervision of the student’s work, her/his performance in viva -voce examinations and group discussions, the quality of their 25 Move to Index work as prescribed through laboratory journals and a semester -end test that contains an experi- ment or a written examination.In -semester work will typically carry 75% and the semester -end test 25% weightage respectively.It is obligatory to maintain a laboratory journal as prescribed by the course instructor.The final examination for laboratory courses will typically be held a week before the final theory examinations .
In case of absence from semester -end examination, the same rules as those for theory courses is applicable. 6.3 Modes of Evaluation for Seminars Seminars are evaluated based on a written report and an oral presentation before a panel of exam- iners appointed by the DUGC/ coordinator.The supervisor /co -supervisor, when involved, are part of the panel.Grades carrying grade points are awarded as in the case of theory and laboratory courses based on the quality of the report and performance in the pres entation.The evaluation of the seminars is completed and the grades submitted to the academic office (one week) before the commencement of the end - semester examination.6.4 Modes of Evaluation for Projects As described in section 2, B.Tech project is not an Institute requirement.
However, some depart- ments may make it as the department requirement for the degree, and some might make it only as a component of the Honours requirement, whereas for Dual Degree, the project is a required com- ponent for the award of degree. As the case may be, the separate modes of assessment are men- tioned hereunder.6.4.1 B.Tech.Project B.Tech.Project may be offered as one unit as BTP, or two independent units as BTP - I and BTP - II.Wherever it is split into two units, BT P - II builds on BTP - I, and BTP - I becomes a pre - requisite for BTP – II.Departments may prescribe a minimum performance in BTP - I (which may be higher than the pass grade ‘DD’) for being eligible for BTP - II.BTP - I and BTP - II are separately grad ed, at the end of the respective semesters.These projects are supervised, and need regular interaction (at least once a week) with the super- visor.Student has to submit a project report and defend it in front of a panel of examiners.
The dates for submiss ion of reports, the dates for presentations, and details of mode of assessment are decided by the individual departments. 6.4.2 Dual Degree Projects a) The following is the schedule for the DDP assessments: I.For evaluation of DDP stage -I, the student has t o submit a report to the respective de- partment.Evaluation will be done, by a panel appointed by the DUGC/ coordinator, based on the report and (a) either an across the table discussion and viva -voce or (b) seminar presentation.The panel shall consist of the supervisor(s) and atleast one more faculty member, to act as examiners.II.For evaluation of DDP stage -II, the student has to submit the reports to the respective departments on or before one week from the date specified in the Academic Calendar.26 Move to Index The eval uation will be done by a Board of Examiners based on the report, and a viva - voce / presentation.
Final Grade reports are to be sent by the Department to the Aca- demic Section on completion of the viva -voce, as per the date specified in the Academic Calendar . b) The Board of Examiners for DDP assessment is approved by the Convener, DUGC, and will consist of the following: (Ref.: 159th & 191st Senate Meeting) For DDP Stage I I.Supervisor(s) II.One Internal Examiner For DDP Stage (Final) II The Final (II) stage assessment will be done by a Board of Examiners appointed by the DPGC/IDPC consisting of the following: I.Supervisor (s) II.Internal Examiner III.External Examiner/Additional Internal Examiner in absence of External Examiner, if approved by t he Academic Unit/Department IV.Chairperson: A Professor/ Associate Professor from another academic unit or a different specialization/ research area.The Academic Unit may decide if a Chairperson is needed for the viva or if one of the Internal Examiners can also act as a Chairperson.
In case the Internal Examiner happens to be a Professor/ Associate Professor, he may be designated to also serve as the Chairperson with prior approval of the Convener, DPGC. c) Submission of Electronic form of Dissertation/ Report (Ref: 204th Senate Meeting) Disser- tations/ Report needs to be submitted in electronic form to the Central Library.Due aca- demic approvals of the final version of the Dissertations/ Reports should be obtained from the supervisor(s) prior to finalizing the archival version of the Dissertation/ Report.The student shall submit the prescribed form for submission of dissertation/report to the aca- demic unit/Academic Office, duly signed by the concerned, within ONE month, from the successful completion of the de fence.If the copies of dissertation submitted after the due date, a fine of Rs.5000/ - per month from the due date of submission till the date of submis- sion will be levied.(Amended in the 207th Senate meeting).
The final transcripts/provisional degree ce rtificate/final degree certificate will be issued only after receipt of disserta- tions/reports. d) The minimum passing grade in each stage of the project assessment shall be “ DD”.e) After registering for DDP (either of the stages), a student should not take up any other as- signment (paid or unpaid) before submitting her/his dissertation.27 Move to Index f) After the Dissertation is assessed, a hard -bound copy of the final Dissertation along with duly completed forms is to be submitted to the Academic office.Soft copies of the Syno psis and the final Dissertation paper are to be submitted to the Central Library.g) The project reports need to be submitted 7 -15 days before the date of evaluation, but not earlier.6.4.3 B.S.Project (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting) On completion of the project, student is required to submit a report and make a presentation to a committee appointed by the department which would award a letter grade.
6.4.4 Extension Rules for Projects (R&D, BTP, DDP, B.S. projects) (Ref.236th Senate Meeting) Grades for all registered project based courses have to be uploaded before the last date for grade submission.The evaluation committee may recommend an II grade for unfinished work due to any reason.Also, if a grade is not uploaded by the academic unit by the last date for grade submission, an II grade will be automatically assigned to the student.In the case of R&D projects, BTP -1, BTP -2, DDP -1 and the first stage of the four year B.S.project and the 5 year integrated M.Sc project, a letter grade to replace the I I grade must be submitted to the academic office, at most 20 days after the last date for grade submission of the previous semester.If a letter grade is not received by the academic office in time, the II grade will be automatically converted to an FR.N o further extensions will be permitted on any grounds for these projects.
The student may re -register for the project (mandatory for DDP -1) in a subsequent semester in case an FR grade is assigned. For the final stage of the B.S./M.Sc project and DDP -2, a letter grade to replace the ‘II’ grade must be submitted to the academic office at most 20 days after the last date for the grade submission.However, the student may apply for an additional extension of at most 15 days (a final deadline of 35 days from th e last date for grade submission of the previous semester), with recommendations and an explanation for the delay by the guide, to the DUGC of the concerned academic unit.Post assessment, the grade may then be sent to the academic office through the Conv ener, DUGC before this date.After this date (35 days from the last date for grade submission for project) the II grade will be automatically converted to an FR grade.The student will then have to re -register for the course in the subsequent semester afte r payment of fees.
No further extensions will be permitted on any grounds for these projects. The decision on allotment of hostel rooms during such extensions is done independently by the Dean (Student Affairs)/ Hostel Co -ordination Unit.6.5 Grading a) India n Institute of Technology Bombay follows grading system.Based on the combined per- formance in all assessments, the student is awarded a letter grade in every course taken by him/her in a particular semester as per the curriculum.These letter grades not on ly indicate 28 Move to Index a qualitative assessment of the student’s performance but also carry a quantitative (nu- meric) equivalent called the Grade Point.
The letter grades and their equivalent grade point are given below: Letter Grade Grade Point AP 10 (Grade is awarded to students with exceptional performance) AA 10 AB 9 BB 8 BC 7 CC 6 CD 5 DD 4 FR 0 {Fail and repeat the course/ equivalent course for mandatory courses (except core)} FF 0 (Fail & Re -examination) DX {Credits are not included in CPI. Attendance below 80% - Repeat the course for core course(s)/equivalent course for mandatory courses (except core)} W Course Withdrawn AU Satisfactory in an Audit course PP Passed NP Not Passed II Incomplete (place holder, gets converted to an appropriate grade after Semester end re -examination, as per applicability) DR Dropped (DR is not a grade but only a position holder indicating that the course has been dropped and it has to be cleared in subse- quent semesters).A student passes the course if he/she gets any grade in the range of “AP” to “DD” (“AU” in the case of an audit course, but fails if he/she gets the grade “FR” and/or “DX” .
”FF”, “II” and “DR” are place holders. b) The grade “AP” indicates exceptional performance and is awarded only in the Course/(s) in which the number of registered students is more than 50.It should not exceed 2 % of the 29 Move to Index total strength of the particular theory or lab course.The grade “AP” is not awarded for pro- jects / seminars.c) An “FR” grade is awarded in case/(s) where, in the opinion of the instructor (panel of exam- iners in the case of projects), the performance of the student is below an acceptable thresh- old in the in -semester and /or end -semester examinations.It may also be awarded for Ac- ademic malpractices.Details pertaining to Academic malpractices are available at: http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/punishments201521July .pdf d) (Ref: 235th Senate Meeting) ‘DX’ grade is awarded to students who have inadequate at- tendance as per following: IIT Bombay expects one hundred percent (1 00 %) from its studen ts in all classes.
If the at- tendance of the student, as counted with effect from the first contact hour, falls below eighty percent of the total attendance expected, the instructor may award the student, ‘Drop due to inadequate attendance’, ‘DX’ grade in t hat course. This ‘Drop due to inade- quate attendance’ Grade would, for the purpose of CPI calculation be treated as equivalent to a ‘Course Drop’ carried out on initiation by the student.In calculating attendance, no specific concession is to be given for lack of attendance on Medical ground.Further, if a student has 80% attendance or more, he/ she cannot be awarded ‘Drop due to inadequate attendance.Only exception to this rule is courses where the instructor has declared a prior in the first week that no DX grade will be awarded.e) For a student present in the semester -end re -examination, the instructor will award a reg- ular performance grade (AP -FR) depending on the overall performance in the course includ- ing the re -examination.
f) There are, however, a few o ther academic requirements for the programmes. The following two grades viz., “PP” (Pass) and “NP” (Not pass), will be awarded for NCC/NSO/NSS.No grade points are associated with these grades and performance in these courses is not taken into account in t he calculation of the performance indices (SPI, CPI).However, the award of the degree is subject to obtaining a “PP” (Pass) grade in all such courses.A student will be awarded “PP” (Pass) / “NP” (Not Pass) grade for NCC/ NSO/NSS in each semester provided the minimum requirement of these activities are met during that semester together with 80% minimum attendance, failing which the “NP” (Not Pass) grade will be awarded.g) (Ref: 239th Senate Meeting - effective from End Semester Examinations of the Spring Se- mester 2019 -20).“FF” grade can be awarded to UG students by the concerned course instructor.
The stu- dents will be given only one chance for re -examination in case of FF grade, otherwise the grade will be converted to FR. Re -exam will be conducted for 50 % weightage (or same as the weightage of end -semester exam for the course).Re -exam for students with FF grade wi ll be conducted along with medical re -exam.The grade will be restricted to “DD” for the re -examination, in case of FF Grade.30 Move to Index h) Course (s) completed by student(s) outside IIT Bombay by means of NPTEL and / or SWAYAM and / or Semester Exchange, following due approval of DUGC/ DPGC, will contribute only towards completion of credits.Grade(s) earned in such courses will not be considered for the SPI/ CPI calculation.The transcript will record such course(s) and the corresponding grade(s) as it is/ they are.
(A pplicable for NPTEL/ SWAYAM courses from the academic year 2020 -2021 onwards and for Semester exchange students for academic year 2021 -22 on- wards.) (Ref: 246th Senate Meeting) i) For 1st year students of UG programme, no direct ‘FR’ grade be awarded after the end se- mester in the 1st attempt. The fail grade will be ‘FF’ at first instance of the examination.The student will have to reappear in the examination of the course, in which he/she has ob- tained ‘FF’ grade.Subsequently, a letter grade DD or FR will be allotted .(Ref: 256th Senate Meeting) 6.6 Valid reasons for semester -end make -up examination (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting) Following may be considered as valid reasons for semester – end make -up examination: a) Serious illness/ accident in the case of the student herself/ himself.Serious illness/ accident/ death of parent/ guardian.6.7 Academic Malpractice Academic malpractices are severely dealt with.
The details pertaining to Academic ma lpractices are available at: http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/punishments201521July.pdf 6.8 Semester Performance Index/ Cumulative Performance Index (SPI/CPI) 6.8.1 Semester Performance Index (SPI) The performance of a student in a semester is indicated by a number called Semester Performance Index, SPI. The SPI is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the courses registered by the student during the semeste r.For example, if a student passes five courses (Theory/labs./Pro- jects/ Seminar etc.) in a semester with credits C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 and her/his grade points in these courses are g1, g2, g3, g4 and g5 respectively, then her/his SPI is equal to: C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 g4 + C5 g5 SPI = ---------------------------------------------------------- C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 The SPI is calculated to two decimal places.The SPI for any semester will take into consideration the FR grades awarded in that semester.
For example, if a student has failed in course 4, the SPI will then be computed as: C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 * ZERO+C5 g5 SPI = ------------------------------------------------------------------- C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 31 Move to Index The courses which do no t form the minimum requirement of the degrees will not be considered for calculation of the SPI. Such additional courses undertaken and the grades earned by the student will be shown separately.The updated SPIs will be shown in the transcript only after t he last date of grade submission (course + project) as per the Academic Calendar.Till then, only the SPI till previous completed semesters will be displayed.6.8.2 Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) An up to date assessment of the overall performance of a student from the time s/he entered the Institute is obtained by calculating a number called the Cumulative Performance Index, CPI, in a manner similar to the calculation of SPI.
The CPI therefore considers all the courses registered by the student, towa rds the minimum requirement of the degree s/he has enrolled for, since s/he en- tered the Institute. The CPI is calculated at the end of every semester to two decimal places.The CPI will reflect the failed status in case of FR grade(s), till the course(s) i s/are cleared.When the course(s) is/are cleared by obtaining a pass grade on subsequent registration(s) the CPI will only reflect the new grade and not the fail grades earned earlier.Example: Up to semester r a student has registered for n courses, among which s/he has a “FR” grade in course i.The semester grade report at the end of semester r therefore will contain a CPI calculated as: C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + ..+Ci* ZERO+Cn gn CPI = ------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ C1 + C2 + C3 + ...+Ci + ...
+ Cn Even if a student has failed in a course more than once, the course will figure only once in the nu- merator as well as the denominator. At the end of semester r+1 s/he has registered for four more courses including the backlog course i and has cleared all the courses including the backlog course, the CPI at the end of this semester is calculated as: C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + ..+Ci*gi+..+Cn gn CPI = ---------------------------------------------------------- ---------- C1 + C2 + C3 + ...+Ci + ...+ Cn The courses which do not form the minimum requirement of the degrees will not be considered for calculation of the basic CPI.These courses will be shown separately.The updated CPI will be shown in the transcr ipt only after the last date of grade submission (course + project) as per the Academic Calendar.Till then, only the CPI till previous completed semesters will be displayed.The Transcript will reflect only two CPI i.e.a) CPI Courses and b) CPI – Courses +Project.
(Ref: 241st Senate Meeting) 32 Move to Index 6.8.3 Semester Grade Report The Senate of IIT Bombay in its 221st Meeting considered discontinuation of issue of Semester Grade Cards from Spring Semester 2014 -15. All students are able to see their grades as soon as concerned Course instructor /Faculty member uploads grades on the ASC.Students may use the data from their interface for the purpose of infor- mation and conveying to their parents as well.6.8.4 The Transcript: Consolidated Statement of Academic Perfor mance Transcript is a consolidated statement of a Academic Performance of a student for all the semesters since joining the programme and is given to a student on successful completion of the programme along with the degree certificate.
For those students who have taken multiple attempts to clear a course, the transcript given on successful completion of the programme will record the entire his- tory of the academic performance of a student in all the courses he/she takes as a student in the Institute. There fore every course registered by a student and the grades obtained there upon (in- cluding FR,DX,W etc.) will be mentioned in the transcript for the courses registered in the Autumn Semester 2016 -17 onwards.(Ref: 225th Senate Meeting).The transcript will re flect only two CPI i.e.a) CPI Courses and b) CPI - Courses + Project.(Ref: 241st Senate Meeting) Additional courses will be shown separately, indicating also the minor / Honours, if any, earned by the student.Additional copies of the transcript can be ob tained if needed, on request and upon payment of applicable fee.Students who have not yet completed the programme can obtain an Interim Transcript, if needed, on request and upon payment of applicable fee.
6.9 Display of In -Semester Performance a) The in -semes ter performance of all students is communicated by the instructor to the stu- dents before the end -semester examination. Those awarded “DX” grades as described in 6.5 (d) above will be clearly identified in this list.b) Based on the in -semester performance, th e instructor may also decide and publish a cut -off (based on the average performance of the class), below which the in -semester performance is considered ‘Unsatisfactory’.This will be the basis on which an instructor may declare a “FR” grade even when a s tudent is absent for the end -semester examination on valid grounds.6.10 Disclosing evaluated material in a course (Ref: 259th Senate Meeting) A course instructor will make arrangements for students to see all evaluated answer scripts, student submissions and other graded material before finalization of grades for theory as well as for lab courses as per dates published in Academic calendar.
6.11 Answer Script Retention period Evaluated answer scripts are preserved by the Instructor/ Departmental Office for one semester. 33 Move to Index 6.12 Compensatory time to PwD students (Ref: 239th Senate Meeting - effective from End Se- mester examination of the Autumn Semester 2019 -20) Compensatory time is to be provided to all PwD students across the Institute during written exami- nation .For PwD Students, ‘compensatory time’ will not be less than 20 minutes per hour of examination for persons who are allowed use of scribe/ reader/ lab assistant.All the ca ndidates with benchmark disability not availing the facility of scribe may be allowed additional time of minimum of one hour for examination of 3 hours duration.In case the duration of the examinat ion is less than an hour, then the duration of additional time will be allowed on pro rata basis.Additional time will not be less than 5 minutes and will be in the multiple of 5”.
PwD students must inform the instructors in advance regarding their need fo r compensatory time during examination. 7.Registration of NPTEL/ SWAYAM Courses: a) A student can take maximum of 12 credits of NPTEL/SWAYAM courses in lieu of depart- mental elective and Institute elective courses for the regular student (not under ARP), an d, (b) a maximum of 24 credits of NPTEL/SWAYAM courses in lieu of any courses including core courses for the students, who are under ARP or in extension years after the approval from DUGC of the parent department towards the partial completion of mandatory academic curriculum.b) A student can take NPTEL/SWAYAM courses as 'Additional Learning' for UG students subject to not exceeding credit limit based on approval of DUGC.(Ref: 243rd Senate Meeting) 7.1 Credit Equivalence of NPTEL/SWAYAM courses with IIT Bom bay courses (249th Senate Meeting): a) 12 Weeks NPTEL/SWAYAM courses would be typically considered equivalent to 6 credits at IIT Bombay.
However, in some special cases, DUGC/DPGC/UGC/PGC may consider and ap- prove 12 weeks NPTEL/SWAYAM course(s) equivalent to 8 credits at IIT Bombay. b) 8 Weeks NPTEL/SWAYAM courses would be considered equivalent to 4 or 3 credits at IIT Bombay, depending on approval of DUGC/DPGC/UGC/PGC.7.2 Policy for registering/ award of grades for NPTEL/ SWAYAM/ Semester Exchange courses (Ref.251st Senate) a) Registration for NPTEL/ SWAYAM courses: Students may register for these courses during registration window as per Academic calendar for that semester.Faculty Advisor can ap- prove these registrations in consultation with DUGC.b) Registration fo r Semester Exchange Courses: Academic Units may register students for these courses as and when student returns from the FRN Institute, as per approval of DUGC.c) Grading - As per Academic calendar for that semester along with other courses.
34 Move to Index d) If no grades are allotted during the approved window, the course will be removed automat- ically from the registration of the students on the last date of Academic Activity, so that there will be no issue in calculating SPI/CPI of the student. 8 CHANGE OF BRANCH The Senate in its 256th meeting has approved the elimination of Branch Change into any of the JOSAA administered branches of admission.This is applicable for the students admitted through JEE (Advanced) 2023 onwards.8.1 Conversion to LASE programme (Ref: 252nd Senate Meeting) In 252nd meeting of the Senate, admission to Liberal Arts, Sciences and Engineering Pro- gramme (LASE) is approved through Branch Change.From Academic year 2022 -2023, the LASE pro- gramme is available for eligible students for branch change.All applicants will be assessed based on a written test and/ or personal interview and academic performance (CPI) of the student at IIT Bom- bay.
The students graduated through LASE curriculum would be awarded a B.S. degree in - (a) Natural Science, or (b) Engineering Science, or (c) Social Science, or (d) Arts and Design, depending on the nature of the completed courses / credit requirements.The student who have applied for LASE programme must meet the following branch change criteria.Students are eligibl e to apply for the change of branch/ programme after completing the first two semesters and before the start of the third semester.A) The Eligibility Criteria for applying for a change of branch/ programme are: a) Completion of the prescribed course credits in the first two semesters.b) No FR/DX/DR/W grades at the end of the first two regular registered semesters.c) NP grade in NOCS shall not be a bar for applying for a branch change.d) NP grade in GC 101 shall not be a bar for applying for a branch change.e) Student s should secure an “eligibility -CPI” of at least 7.0 .
The “eligibility - CPI” is calculated taking into account only the following 1st year courses: i. Introduction to HASMED (8 Credits) ii.DIC-1 (6 Credits), if applicable iii.DIC-2 (6 Credits), if applicable iv.Maker Space (MS 101 = 8 Credits) v.Physics Lab (PH 117 = 3 Credits) vi.Chemistry Lab (CH 117 = 3 Credits) B) The calculation of CPI for “Change of Branch”, henceforth referred to as the “Branch - Change -CPI”, will be based only on grades obtained in the following 1st year theory courses: a) Physics: PH 110 (8 credits), if applicable b) Chemistry: CH 111 (8 credits), if applicable c) Mathematics courses: MA 105 (8 credits) and MA 110 (8 credits), if applicable d) Biology (BB 101 = 6 credits), if applicable e) Computer Programming and Ut ilization (CS 101 = 6 credits), if applicable 35 Move to Index C) a) Before beginning the allocation, additional seats are made available in each branch, limited to a maximum of 10% of its sanctioned strength.
b) While students are allotted seats of general and reserved type during admission, this data is not used during branch change. Each available seat may be occupied by students of any category.D) An eligible student's request for a shift from branch A to branch B will be considered valid if any one of the following two sets of criteria are satisfied.Set 1 i.the “Branch -Change -CPI” of the student is at least 9 ii.there is a seat available in Branch B Set 2 i.There is a seat available in Branch B.ii.The strength in branch A, from which a change is being sought, does not fall below its sanctioned strength by more than 25%.iii.There is no student with either (I) higher “Branch -Change -CPI” or (II) same “Branch - Change -CPI” and higher “overall -CPI” who is currently bei ng denied a branch change from any other branch X to branch B due to the strength of branch X falling below its sanctioned strength by more than 25% due to rule (ii).
Procedure Among all valid requests, students with the highest “Branch -Change -CPI” are co nsidered for shifting first. In case more than one student has the same “Branch -Change -CPI” then the “overall -CPI” will be used to break ties and a student among the above with the highest “overall -CPI” will be shifted.In case there is a tie for both the “Branch -Change -CPI” and the “overall - CPI”, then the fol- lowing will apply: If a student with “Branch -Change -CPI” x and “overall -CPI” y is shifted from branch A to branch B then every student with “Branch -Change -CPI” x and “overall -CPI” y with a request for branch B will be shifted to branch B, even if their request violates (ii) above.If necessary, extra seats will be created to accommodate them.Shifts as above are performed as long as there are valid requests.E) All changes of branch can be effected on ly once at the beginning of the second academic year.
No application for change of branch during the subsequent academic years will be entertained. F) Branch change decisions will be final and will not be reversed.G) To run the LASE programme, the minimum stude nt strength for the LASE programme should be 10.If less than 10 students are allotted the LASE programme after branch change then the result will be considered as null and void.36 Move to Index 9 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS 9.1 Award of Degree On successful completion of t he prescribed requirements for a programme {B.Tech.; B.S.; Dual De- gree (B.Tech.and M.Tech.)}, degree will be conferred on a student in an annual convocation of the Institute.The degree certificate will indicate the relevant branch, and specializations if any, in the engineering or science discipline in which the student has graduated.
For example: Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering, Master of Science in Chemistry, or Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering and Master of Technology in Ele ctrical Engineering with Specialization in Microelectronics. In those cases where the student has earned the required credits for an Honours in her/his discipline or a Minor in another discipline within the stipulated time, this will be mentioned in the de gree certificate: for example: a) B.Tech.in Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science with Minor in Environmental Sci- ences and Engineering.b) B.Tech.in Mechanical Engineering with Honours.c) B.Tech.in Mechanical Engineering with Honours and Minor in Elec trical Engineering.d) B.Tech.in Aerospace Engineering.For Dual Degree students a) B.Tech.in Chemical Engineering and M.Tech.in Chemical Engineering with Specialization (if any).b) B.Tech.In Chemical Engineering with Minor in Electrical Engineering and M.Tech .
In Chemical Engineering with Specialization (if any). Along with the degree certificate, the student will be given a complimentary copy of transcript, giv- ing semester -wise details of all academic accomplishments.The additional courses taken, whether earning a minor/ Honours or not, will be separately mention ed in the transcript.If an Honours/ minor is earned that will also be mentioned.An overall CPI for all the academic work done by the student will be given.The transcript and the final degree certificate will not mention any class what- soever; only the CP I/s will be given in the transcript.Honours is not indicative of class.For conferment of degree, student has to fulfill the following requirements: a) The student should have taken and passed all the courses prescribed for the degree under the general insti tutional and departmental requirements.
b) The student should have satisfactorily fulfilled other academic requirements such as practical training, NSS/NSO/NCC, work visits, seminar and projects, as specified for the discipline/pro- gramme. c) The student should h ave paid all the Institute dues.37 Move to Index d) The student should have no case of indiscipline pending against him/her.9.2 Award of Medals (Ref.260th Senate Meeting) The rules and procedures for Award of Medals and Academic prizes is available at the following link: https://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/RulesforAwardofMedalsandAcademicpriz- esforUGandPG.pdf 9.3 Transfer to Academic Rehabilitation Programme (ARP) : (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting) Given that some of the best talents in the country take admission at this Institute, it is expected that all of them perform very well, and fully utilize the various opportunities provided for their academic advancement.However, in a few cases, students a re unable to cope with the studies here.
This may often be due to a lack of aptitude or a mismatch between the student’s interest and what the pro- grammes provide. Early recognition of this tendency permits corrective action to be taken in time, and the stu dents to pursue their careers elsewhere.The students with poor Academic performance are transferred to the Academic Rehabilitation programme (ARP) (Ref.Sec 10) 9.4 Exit Degree option for Undergraduates (Ref: 253rd Senate Meeting) I) Eligibility Criteria: 1.The students admitted and registered in the regular undergraduate programme, viz.B.Tech., B.S., B.Des., B.Tech.+M.Tech.(DD) shall be eligible for an exit degree, if they fulfill the following criteria: (A) Minimum 160 credits to be completed as detailed below: (i) ES 200 and HS 200 (3+3 = 6 Credits); AND (ii) Minimum Dept.credits = 60 for specialization.OR (iii) Minimum Science and Engg.credits = 60 without specialization.(B) Minimum duration of B.Sc.(Engineering) and related exit degrees will be 6 se- mesters.
Students can apply for an exit degree after 4th semester. (C) The specialization can only be in the dept.they are registered in at the time of application.2.The exit degree option is also available to all students who were admitted to the UG Programmes, who have not completed their degree requirements within the stipulated time and have not been terminated.II) Process to apply: 1.A student can apply for the Exi t Degree throu gh prescribed application form (Annexure I) and submit to the Faculty Advisor.2.Faculty Advisor may recommend the application to the DUGC.3.DUGC may recommend the application to the UGAPEC Convener.4.UGAPEC Convener may approve the application.38 Move to Index III) Degree Nomenclature: 1.Exit from B.Tech./Dual Degree (B.Tech.+ M.Tech.) is mapped to B.Sc.(Engg.)

The Undergraduate Research Awards (URA) is designed for such students.URA will be available at three levels, all of them independent of each other.They will carry codes similar to course codes so that they can be listed in grade reports.URA01: for preliminary research/ developmental experience URA02: for B.Tech.Level Research Project.
URA03: for Dual Degree Level Research Project URA01: This is a recognition of a small research/ developmental effort, successfully completed by a student in the first, second or third year of an undergraduate prog ramme – that is, a B.Tech., B.S. or a Dual Degree Programme.A faculty member must agree to supervise the student for the URA01 project.The student works with this faculty member, with the approval of the DUGC, for four -to-six month duration – including t he summer or winter vacations.No formal registration is required with the academic office at this stage.If the faculty member is satisfied with the quantum and quality of work done, at any stage, s/he may recommend the award of URA01 to the student, whic h will then be listed in the transcript of the student in the semester immediately following the semester in which this award was recommended.No credits are assigned to URA01.URA01 can be awarded only once to a student.The grade for URA01 will be “PP”.
URA02: This is to be treated as recognition of truly exceptional work, both in quality and in extent, done in the B.Tech. Project.If the committee evaluating the B.Tech.Project of a B.Tech.student believes that the student has carried out truly exceptio nal work in the B.Tech.Project and the quan- tum of work is substantially higher than what is expected, it may recommend that two more faculty members, other than those who already participated in the committee for evaluation, duly chosen by the DUGC, exami ne the work done and evaluate whether a URA02 can be awarded to the student in addition to the AA grade already given.A joint recommendation must then be made by all: the original committee of evaluation and these two other faculty members that this stude nt be awarded URA02, duly routed through the Convener, DUGC to the Convener, UGAPEC.This award, on ap- proval by the UGAPEC, will be mentioned on the grade report of the student as URA02 carrying six credits and the grade AA.
No formal registration is requi red with the academic office. The advantage to the student would be that his / her CPI would improve, given that these credits are with an AA grade.URA 2 is not available for DD students.S tudents should have earned minimum of 12 credits in BTP, in order to apply for URA 02 (Ref: 241st Senate Meeting) 41 Move to Index URA03: These are to be treated as recognition of truly exceptional work, both in quality and in ex- tent, in the Dual Degree Project.If the committee evaluating the Final Stage of the Dual Degree Project of a given Dual Degree student believes that the student has carried out truly exceptional work and the quantum of work is substantially higher than what is expected, it may recommend that two more faculty members, other than those who already participated in the committee for evaluation, duly chosen by the DUGC, examine the work done and evaluate whether a URA03 can be awarded to the student in addition to the AA grade already given.
A joint recommendation must then be made by all: the original committee of e valuation and these two other faculty members that this student be awarded URA03, duly routed through the Convener, DUGC to the Convener, UGAPEC. This award, on approval by the UGAPEC, will be mentioned on the grade report of the student as URA03 carrying six credits and the grade AA.No formal registration is required with the academic office.The advantage to the student would be that his / her CPI would improve, given that these credits are with an AA grade.11.ACADEMIC REHABILITATION PROGRAMME (ARP) The Academic Rehabilitation Program (ARP) deals with students with poor performance in academ- ics.It acts as a buffer for such students and provides them with an opportunity to continue in the institute and successfully complete their respective degrees.A student is transferred to ARP on re- ceiving FR/DX grades for at least 36 credits in core courses.
A faculty member in each department, called the ARP Faculty Adviser, will assist students of that department to register for courses man- ually, for a maximum o f 24 credits. A student, who is able to reduce the total number of FR/DX credits to less than 36 as above is trans- ferred back to being a regular student.On failure to exit the ARP after three consecutive semesters in the program, termination of registrat ion from the program may be recommended.12.ALLOWING B.TECH.& B.S.STUDENTS TO LEAVE AFTER COMPLETING THEIR CREDIT RE- QUIREMENTS FOR B.TECH.& B.S.PROGRAMME EARLIER THAN 4 YEARS The Senate in its 224th and 229th meeting approved the proposal of allowing B.Tech.& B.S.students to leave after completing their credit requirements for B.Tech.& B.S.Programme earlier than 4 years on the following terms and conditions : a) B.Tech./B.S.
students can apply for leaving the Institute at the end of an academic semes ter provided their credit requirements are met and they have spent atleast three years in the institute. b) The Convener, UGAPEC may approve the Credit Completion certificate, which can be given to the students, after clearance of all dues.c) These students wil l be awarded their degree in the ensuing Annual Convocation as sched- uled in Academic calendar.d) The passing date would be the date UGAPEC approves the results, which will be the date to be mentioned on Transcripts.e) The duration of programme would be still m entioned as 4 year B.Tech/ B.S.programme.42 Move to Index f) Re-registration as a student will not be permitted.These students can register for place- ment opportunities, but would not get hostel facilities during their placement activities.13.CONVERSION FROM B.TECH.TO DU AL DEGREE (B.TECH.+M.TECH.) PROGRAMME (Ref: 240th Senate Meeting) B.Tech.

43 Move to Index d) The list of the short -listed candidates will be forwarded to Convener, UGAPEC by the Con- vener, DUGC / DPGC/ PGC of the admitting [destination] academic units. An academic unit can also provide a waiting list based on the merit.e) The final list of selected candidates will be conveyed to the Convener, DUGC of the respec- tive parent academic units and the Convener, DUGC / DPGC/ PGC of the destination aca- demi c units.The final list will also be conveyed to Associate/ Dean, Student Affairs for ad- justment in hostel accommodation.C.Rules & Regulations: a) IDDDP is only for the movement of students from one academic unit to another.b) A DD specialization / M.Tech.program usually requires the completion of 8 to 9 courses of 6 credits and a DD/M.Tech.project (DDP/MTP) of 74 - 92 credits.c) IDDDP should be treated as (b).Accordingly, in addition to B.Tech./ B.S.of the parent aca- demic unit, IDDDP students should comp lete the following (2021 batch onwards): I.
If host academic unit offering M.Tech. has a UG programme with honours, IDDDP students will be required to do 24 credits from the Honours basket and at least 24 credits from PG level/ advanced elective courses as prescribed by the host academic unit and a DD/ M.Tech.project (DDP/MTP) of 72 - 90 credits in order to earn M.Tech.degree of the ad- mitting academic unit.II.In cases where the host academic unit offering M.Tech.does not have a UG programme with honours, IDDDP students will be required to do at least 48 credits from PG level/ advanced elective courses as prescribed by the host academic unit and a DD/ M.Tech.pro- ject (DDP/MTP) of 72 - 90 credits in order to earn M.Tech.degree of the admitting aca- demic unit.III.For M.Sc./ MBA, requirements will be as approved by the Senate.d) An admitting academic unit can prescribe additional courses over and above that required for IDDDP, which may diff er depending on the parent academic unit of the incoming student.
e) In addition to the IDDDP requirements, if a student completes 24.0 credits towards the hon- ors of the parent department, then he/ she will be considered for award of B. Tech./ B.S.with honor s of the parent department subject to the recommendation of DUGC of the par- ent department (2021 batch onwards).f) An admitting academic unit: I.must prescribe required courses to the student at the time of admitting the student to IDDDP.II.will verify whether the M.Tech./ M.Sc./ MBA requirements have been met at the end of the IDDD programme.III.will have a limit of two students in each unit of specialization except in the case of KCDH and CMInDS (8 TA + 22 RAP for each).44 Move to Index g) The selection and entry of all candidates in IDDDP will remain provisional till the successful completion of B.S./ B.Tech.curriculum by the end of 8th semester.

Arpit Agarwal Arpit Agarwal Assistant Professor Computer Science & Engineering Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay Email: agarpit [at] outlook.com About Me I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay.Prior to joining IIT Bombay, I was a postdoctoral researcher at FAIR Labs (Meta) working with Max Nickel on socially responsible recommendation systems.Before that I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Data Science Institute at Columbia University hosted by Prof.Yash Kanoria and Prof.Tim Roughgarden.I completed my PhD from the Department of Computer & Information Science at University of Pennsylvania, under the guidance of Prof.Shivani Agarwal.My research lies in the area of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).Specifically, I am interested in the interaction of humans with ML/AI systems.This includes topics in learning from implicit, strategic, and heterogenous human feedback.
This also includes understanding the dynamics in the interaction between humans and AI and understanding how one influences the other in the long-term. Finally, this also includes responsible design of AI systems and understanding/mitigating undesired consequences on individuals and society.Updates I co-organized an ICML'24 workshop "Humans, Algorithmic Decision-Making and Society: Modeling Interactions and Impact".Research Publications Learning-Augmented Dynamic Submodular Maximization Arpit Agarwal, Eric Balkanski.To Appear at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2024.[arXiv preprint] Semi-Bandit Learning for Monotone Stochastic Optimization Arpit Agarwal, Rohan Ghuge, Viswanath Nagarajan.To Appear at IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) 2024.[arXiv preprint] System-2 Recommenders: Disentangling Utility and Engagement in Recommendation Systems via Temporal Point-Processes Arpit Agarwal, Nicolas Usunier, Alessandro Lazaric, Maximilian Nickel.

Current research interests Representation learning for graph search We are exploring how to go beyond shallow graph neural networks to represent nodes, edges and graphs for better link prediction and searching a corpus of graphs with a query graph with trainable notions of subgraph isomorphism. Better embedding representation for entities, types, relations, and time We are studying how to embed entities, types, relations and time to infer new edges in regular and temporal knowledge graphs, and their application to (temporal) question answering.Complex multi-modal question answering With IBM Research, I am exploring how to translate complex queries involving knowledge base access, arithmetic and logical operations into structured programs with memory.Code-switched text analysis Indian languages borrow heavily from English, resulting in ``code switching'' languages like Hindlish, Benglish, etc., the lingua franca of social media.
We are investigating how to improve standard NLP tasks by generating synthetic code-switched text, and designing multi-task low-supervision recurrent networks. [The World Wide Web is] the only thing I know of whose shortened form â WWW â takes three times longer to say than what it's short for.—Douglas Adams Past projects Searching the annotated Web with entities, types and relations We built CSAW, a search system that integrates type and role annotations with keyword matches, thereby exploiting lexical ontologies and entity taggers within an information retrieval system.Graph conductance search Rich connections between random walks, graph eigensystems, and electrical networks make it attractive to apply them for ranking nodes.PageRank is a prominent example of the paradigm.In PageRank, the edge weights are fixed and we have to compute steady state probabilities of nodes.What if we have something like the opposite problem?And how to make this fast at query time?
Supported by IBM and Microsoft (2007, 2008). Integrating IR with databases In the BANKS project, we proposed new paradigms of keyword search in graphs that can represent text embedded in relational or XML-like data.The effect of search engines on the Web graph and page popularity Search engines are influenced by the (in)degree of Web pages, but their ranked lists modulate page popularity and eventually their (in)degree, setting up a feedback to some degree.Might the evolution of the Web graph be influenced substantially by the existence of search engines?Is there a need to regulate monopolies?What are healthy economic objectives, and how to optimize them?Focused crawlers to build topic-specific portals A focused crawler collects a topic-specific subgraph of the Web by coupling classifiers and reinforcement learners with crawlers.An open-source focused crawler project was started at the Lab.for Intelligent Internet Research and is available.
Mining hypertext to estimate topics and popularity I built a hypertext classifier that uses the text in and links around a given Web page to label it with a topic. This was an early application of Markov networks to Web analysis.As a member of the IBM Clever Project, I worked on algorithms to analyze the links around a web page and the text in pages that cite the given page to assign it a measure of popularity.Compiling and running parallel scientific programs In a previous life, my PhD thesis was on the design and implementation of compilers and runtime systems for distributed memory multiprocessors.Seems like distributed parallel computing is hot again, thanks to "Big Data"!Downloads Recent papers are listed below with accompanying git repo links.Some older software can be found here.Professional activity Journal editorship Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval (a review journal started in 2006) 2006–2022.ACM Transactions on the Web, 2006–2011.

Supratik Chakraborty Supratik Chakraborty Bajaj Group Chair Professor Department of Computer Science and Engineering Indian Institute of Technology Bombay CV Publications Tutorials and Invited Talks Teaching Other Professional Activities Contact I work in the area of formal methods, developing theory, algorithms and computational tools that help in building verifiably correct hardware, software and intelligent systems.Such systems increasingly pervade our lives, yet their growing complexity makes it humanly impossible to reason about all corner case behaviours.Mathematically provable guarantees are therefore crucial to ensure that the systems we increasingly trust our lives on are indeed trustworthy.
My research focuses on (i) formal verification, wherein we provide a formal proof that a system satisfies a property or demonstrate its violation, (ii) rigorous analysis of system models to extract meaningful information, and (iii) automated synthesis of systems from specifications, with the guarantee that the synthesized system satisfies the specification. I have applied formal methods to reason about software, hardware, machine learning and biological systems.The gap between theory and practice of formal methods concerns me deeply and I have consciously tried to bridge this gap in my work.I'm also affiliated to Centre for Formal Design and Verification of Software and Centre for Liberal Education at IIT Bombay.

You may also want to look at some infrequently updated publications, and the aforementioned talks and papers (check out the abstract to figure out what is going on). Teaching: I am teaching Computer Vision cum Lab this semester.This course is a "second" level course past Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing with any CSE student audience (see details in link).Courses I have offered in the past include (all course notes work under the Creative Commons model): CS101: Basic freshman programming , Software Systems, Parallel Programming Paradigms (PPP), Math for Visual Computing, Graphics I, Multimedia Systems, Computer Vision, Digital Image Processing, Graphics II, Digital Signal Processing, Algorithms, Spatial Data Structures, Multimedia (in distance mode), and (in the era when HTML did not exist) Data Structures and Algorithms, and Advanced Computer Graphics.Postgraduate students: What courses should you attend, and what kind of project work would you do in this area?
Project: One way to figure out what kind of projects you might do with me is to look at the recent students who have worked with me. (For example, you probably want to talk to my current Ph.D students and see their work.) For seminar and projects policies, please refer to the ViGIL group presentation, and don't forget to visit this page.Courses: Your choice, really but these are some courses that I like to recommend.You can register for any course in CS, EE or Math, but you take 3 courses + seminar in the first sem + a lab, 4 courses in the second semester, and 2 in the third semester.Note that you can substitute one course by a R&D project in the second semester.Odd semester: CS475/CS675 (Open GL based Basic Graphics); CS663 (Fundamentals of Digital Image Processing).CS 740 (Math for Visual Computing).These are pre-requisites for the even semester courses.Even semester: CS775 (Advanced Computer Graphics); CS763 (Computer Vision).

Parag Chaudhuri Parag Chaudhuri Parag Chaudhuri Home Courses Projects Publications Musings Contact Light Dark Automatic Parag Chaudhuri Professor Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay My research centers around the animation of characters and natural phenomena to populate virtual worlds.We develop computational models to replicate the behaviour and appearance of real world phenomena and people, in order to create richer virtual experiences.Another research direction I am interested in is the study of methods to create, interact with and understand visual data.We study methods to parse and understand visual data in the real world, and also develop tools and systems for generating and editing both 2D and 3D visual data.The work combines ideas from computer graphics, virtual and augmented reality, computer vision, applied physics and machine learning.
It finds application in training and teaching, entertainment in films and games, medical simulation, industrial process simulation, software testing and digital heritage. I am a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay.Here I love teaching computer graphics to enthusiastic students.Earlier, I spent a couple of years daydreaming beside the picturesque Lake Geneva, as a postdoctoral reasearcher at MIRALab in the University of Geneva where I worked with Nadia Magnenat Thalmann.I spent some wonderful Ph.D.years at IIT Delhi, supervised by Prem Kalra and Subhashis Banerjee.In a prior academic life, I was a very serious undergraduate student in the Department of Civil Engineering, at the Delhi College of Engineering.If you are a student who wants to work with me, please read this.Copyright Â© 2024 Parag Chaudhuri This work is licensed under CC BY NC SA 4.0 Published with Wowchemy â the free, open source website builder that empowers creators.

Abir De: Webpage Research interests Publications Recognitions Workshop/tutorial Abir De Assistant Professor Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay $MyFirstName@cse.iitb.ac.in Research Interests My current research focus is designing machine learning models and methods for structured objects, e.g., graphs and sets.The specific sub-areas that I am currently working in are as follows: Differentiable surrogates for combinatorial algorithms on graphs using neural networks.We are working on designing neural networks which approximate hard decision tasks on graphs.For e.g., we have developed neural tools for subgraph isomorphism and maximum common subgraph detection.For details, please look into ISONET, XMCS.Data-efficient machine learning.Modern machine learning models are trained on datasets of ever increasing size.Such models are often compute-hungry and require expensive maintenance and have large energy footprint.
To tackle this problem, we have proposed compute efficient methods to strategically select training instances, such that overall performance does not degrade. In our past projects, we have used both combinatorial and neurally guided subset selection methods.See Selcon, Gradmatch, Subselnet, Fhashnet.Neural models of set functions.We are working on designing neural models for submodular or approximate submodular functions.See Flexsubnet.Human in the loop machine learning.We are developing methods to distribute decision tasks across humans and machines.See for example AAAI 2020, AAAI 2021 and NeurIPS 2021 papers.We are also working on how to effectively query features to facilitate assistance.See Genex.Information diffusion.Despite this being quite a rich and classical topic, we have developed methods for novel information cascade problems, e.g., problems involving capacity constraints, and preference estimation.See publications for more details.

Chethan Kamath Chethan Kamath I am an assistant professor at the CSE department at IIT Bombay, where I am a member of the Theory Group and Trust Lab.My primary field of research is cryptography, particularly its foundations.But my interests extend beyond to theoretical computer science [+] BIO 2024- Assistant Professor at IIT Bombay 2021-2023 Post-doc at Tel Aviv University, hosted by Nir Bitansky and Omer Paneth I was supported by an Azrieli fellowship 2020-21 Post-doc at Charles University, hosted by Pavel HubÃ¡Äek 2020 Post-doc at Northeastern university, hosted by Daniel Wichs 2014-2020 PhD from IST Austria, under the supervision of Krzysztof Pietrzak My PhD thesis was titled On the Average-Case Hardness of Total Search Problems.
2010-2013 Master's in CS from IISc Bangalore, under the supervision of Sanjit Chatterjee My master's thesis was titled Constructing Provably Secure Identity-Based Signature Schemes 2005-2009 Bachelor's in CS from University of Kerala (at TKM College of Engineering, Kollam). Short-term visits Simons Institute - Summer 2015 FACT Center - Summer 2017, hosted by Alon Rosen Charles University, Prague - October 2017, 2019, July 2022, hosted by Pavel HubÃ¡Äek [+] PUBLICATIONS Batch Proofs are Statistically Hiding with Nir Bitansky, Omer Paneth, Ron Rothblum and Prashant Nalini Vasudevan STOC 2024 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides [↗] Talk by Prashant Problem: Given \(t\) instances of SAT, the trivial way for an efficient prover to convince a verifier that all \(t\) instances are satisfiable is to send all the \(t\) satisfying assignments.Is it possible to do better in terms of communication?This is the problem of batch verification for \(\mathbf{NP}\).
Result: We show (among other results) that this is unlikely by proving that such an interactive protocol can be used to construct a protocol that is (statistically) hides information about the assignments, which is believed to be unlikely. (Verifiable) Delay Functions from Lucas Sequences with Charlotte Hoffmann, Pavel HubÃ¡Äek and TomÃ¡Å¡ KrÅÃ¡k TCC 2023 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by TomÃ¡Å¡ [↗] Talk by TomÃ¡Å¡ Problem: A delay function is, loosely speaking, a function whose output cannot be computed faster even given parallelism.A verifiable delay function (VDF) is a delay function whose output can be "publicly certified" so that it can be verified by any party.Can we construct VDFs from weaker assumptions that those currently known?Result: We design (V)DFs assuming hardness of computing Lucas sequences in RSA group.
Furthermore, we conjecture that this assumption is a weaker than the Rivest-Shamir-Wagner assumption, on which several current VDF candidates (Pietrzak's and Wesolowski's) are based on. Certifying Giant Nonprimes with Charlotte Hoffman, Pavel HubÃ¡Äek and Krzysztof Pietrzak PKC 2023 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by Charlotte [↗] Talk by Charlotte Problem: GIMPS and PrimeGrid are large-scale volunteer projects dedicated to searching giant prime numbers of special forms like Mersenne and Proth primes.The numbers in the current search-space are millions of digits large and a participating volunteer needs to run resource-consuming primality tests.Once a candidate prime \(N\) has been found, the only way for another party to independently verify the primality of \(N\) used to be by repeating the expensive primality test.Can we do better?Result: We propose a practical mechanism for certifying the non-primality of Proth numbers.
That is, a volunteer can â parallel to running the primality test for \(N\) â generate an efficiently verifiable proof at a little extra cost certifying that \(N\) is not prime. The proof is obtained by applying the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to our interactive protocol, which has statistical soundness.PPAD is as Hard as LWE and Iterated Squaring with Nir Bitansky, Arka Rai Choudhuri, Justin Holmgren, Alex Lombardi, Omer Paneth and Ron Rothblum TCC 2022 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides [↗] Talk Problem: In [11,12], we showed hardness of the class \(\mathbf{PPAD}\) in the random-oracle model (additionally assuming worst-case hardness of \(\#\)SAT).Follow-up works [JKKZ20,LV20] weakened the assumptions, but still rely on non-standard cryptographic assumptions.Is it possible to show \(\mathbf{PPAD}\)-hardness from polynomial hardness of standard cryptographic assumptions?
Result: We use the recent results of Holmgren, Lombardi and Rothblum [HLR21] to derandomise the proof of exponentiation protocol of Block et al. [BHR+21], which yields hardness in \(\mathbf{PPAD}\) from polynomial hardness of iterated squaring (in any group) and learning with errors.Furthermore, we strengthen this to show hardness of \(\mathbf{UEOPL}\subseteq\mathbf{PPAD}\), which is one of the lowest sub-classes of \(\mathbf{TFNP}\).Practical Statistically-Sound Proofs of Exponentiation in Any Group with Charlotte Hoffman, Pavel HubÃ¡Äek, Karen Klein and Krzysztof Pietrzak Crypto 2022 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by Charlotte [↗] Talk by Charlotte Problem: For a group \(\mathbb{G}\), a proof of exponentiation allows a prover to convince a verifier that \(y=x^{q^T}\) for \((y,x,q,T)\in\mathbb{G}^2\times\mathbb{N}^2\).The existing constructions are either impractical [BHK+12] or guarantee weak soundness [Pie19,Wes20].Can we have the best of both worlds?
Result: Building upon [BHK+12], we show that this is indeed possible for `structured' \(q\). Moreover, we show that for applications, such structured \(q\) suffices.Limits on the Adaptive Security of Yaoâs Garbling with Karen Klein, Krzysztof Pietrzak and Daniel Wichs Crypto 2021 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by Karen [↗] Talk by Karen Problem: Can the upper bounds for loss in security of Yao's garbling shown in [7,18] improved?Result: We show that this is not possible using black-box reductions by building upon the result in [16].As in [16], we use pebbling lower bounds and oracle separations.On Treewidth, Separators and Yaoâs Garbling with Karen Klein and Krzysztof Pietrzak TCC 2021 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides [↗] Talk Problem: In the 80s, Yao proposed an elegant way to securely evaluate functions using garbled circuits.Is his garbling scheme fully secure?
Result: Although security in a simulation-based model is known to be unattainable [AIKW13], we show that it is secure in the -- next-best -- indistinguishability-based model for some circuit classes. To this end, we use tools from algorithmic graph theory (e.g., treewidth) and circuit complexity On the Cost of Adaptivity in Security Games on Graphs with Karen Klein, Krzysztof Pietrzak and Michael Walter TCC 2021 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by Karen [↗] Talk by Karen Problem: Are the upper bounds for loss in security established in [7,10] optimal?Result: We show that for certain cryptographic primitives whose security model involves the adversary constructing a dynamic graph -- like, e.g., constrained PRF and group key agreement -- this is indeed the case when restricted to 'oblivious' reductions.In particular, we use pebbling lower bounds and oracle separations to show fine-grained lower bounds on loss in security for these primitives.
Keep the Dirt: Tainted TreeKEM, an Efficient and Provably Secure Group Key Agreement Protocol with JoÃ«l Alwen, Margarita Capretto, Miguel Cueto, Karen Klein, Guillermo Pascual-Perez, Krzysztof Pietrzak and Michael Walter S&ampP 2021 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by Guillermo [↗] Talk by Guillermo Problem: Is TreeKEM, a continuous group key-agreement messaging protocol (currently being standardised by IETF), secure? Result: We propose Tainted TreeKEM, a slight variant of TreeKEM, and show that it is secure in a passive setting with only quadratic loss in security (in the random oracle model).On Average-Case Hardness in TFNP from One-Way Functions with Pavel HubÃ¡Äek, Karel KrÃ¡l and Veronika SlÃ­vovÃ¡ TCC 2020 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides by Veronika [↗] Talk by Veronika Problem: In [12,13] we showed the existence of hard problems in lower sub-classes of TFNP under some cryptographic assumptions.
But can we construct hard problems in TFNP from one-way functions, the weakest assumption in cryptography? Result: For a restricted class of black-box reductions, we show that this is not possible.F Finding a Nash Equilibrium is no Easier than Breaking Fiat-Shamir with Arka Rai Choudhuri, Pavel HubÃ¡Äek, Krzysztof Pietrzak, Alon Rosen and Guy Rothblum STOC 2019 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↓] Slides [↗] Talk by Alon Problem: How hard is it to find a Nash equilibrium?Result: We show that the complexity class \(\mathbf{PPAD}\), for which Nash equilibrium is complete, is (average-case) hard as long as the Fiat-Shamir transform is sound.Furthermore we extend this hardness to the class \(\mathbf{CLS}\) \(\subseteq\mathbf{PPAD}\).PPAD-Hardness via Iterated Squaring Modulo a Composite with Arka Rai Choudhuri, Pavel HubÃ¡Äek, Krzysztof Pietrzak, Alon Rosen and Guy Rothblum Preprint 2019 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper Problem: How hard is the complexity class \(\mathbf{PPAD}\)?
Result: We show (average-case) hardness in PPAD under the assumption that the problem of repeated squaring in the RSA modulus is hard. Furthermore we extend this hardness to the class \(\mathbf{CLS}\) \(\subseteq\mathbf{PPAD}\).Remark: The results in the paper are superseded by [12].Reversible Proofs of Sequential Work with Hamza Abusalah, Karen Klein, Krzysztof Pietrzak and Michael Walter Eurocrypt 2019 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper [↗] Talk by Hamza Problem: A proof of sequential work (also known as proof of time), defined by Mahmoody, Moran and Vadhan , allows a prover to convince a verifier that it has done a certain amount of sequential computation.Can we have a proof of sequential work where the computation is reversible?Result: We show this to be possible in the random oracle model by exploiting the Skip list data structure.
Adaptively-Secure Proxy Re-encryption with Georg Fuchsbauer, Karen Klein and Krzysztof Pietrzak PKC 2019 [+] Synopsis [↗] Paper Problem: A proxy re-encryption (PRE) is a public-key encryption scheme that allows the holder of a key \(pk\) to derive a re-encryption key for any other key \(pk'\). This re-encryption key lets anyone transform ciphertexts under \(pk\) into ciphertexts under \(pk'\) without having to know the underlying message.Can we have secure PRE in the setting where the adversary gets to corrupt users in arbitrary, adaptive manner?Result: We show that in case the graph constructed by the adversary is restricted, then some of the constructions already achieve adaptive security.We make use of the framework from [7].

This comes at significant cost including larger resource costs (multiple expensive GPUs and cloud costs), training times (often times multiple days), and human labeling costs and time.Decile attempts to solve this by answering the following question.Can we train state of the art deep models with only a sample (say 5 to 10\%) of massive datasets, while having neglibible impact in accuracy?Can we do this while reducing training time/cost by an order of magnitude, and/or significantly reducing the amount of labeled data required?.

Sudarshan's Home Page S.Sudarshan Subrao M.Nilekani Chair Professor Dept.of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay Schedule Publications Research Areas Professional Activities Courses Students Other Stuff Contact Publications Database System Concepts 7th Ed., by Silberschatz, Korth and Sudarshan, released March 2019.Publications (My entry in the DBLP bibliography, and my profile in Google Scholar) Research Areas My main research area is database systems .Current sub areas of interest include Holistic optimization spanning the programming language/SQL boundary.This project addresses optimization of database applications where the bottleneck is in the programming language -- database interface.We have developed techniques for automated rewriting of database applications, which can replace iterative invocation of queries by creating query batches, or asynchronous query invocation, and in other cases replace blocks of code by equivalent SQL queries.
This work spans the boundaries of programming language static analysis and database query optimization. For details see the home page of the DBridge Project at http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/dbms/dbridge.Query Optimization.The Pyro query optimization project, which is based on the Volcano/Cascades framework, has run for many years, with early work focusing on multiquery optimization and parametric query optimization.More recently we have been working on handling query optimization for parallel databases, including optimization of response time, or more generally multi-objective query optimization, which add non-trivial complexity to the optimization problem.For details see the home page of the Pyro/PyroJ project at http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/dbms/pyro.Testing Database Queries and Applications.The XData project focuses on how to test the correctness of database queries, and more generally, database applications, by generating datasets that are designed to catch errors.
We have developed techniques for data generation which can handle a wide variety of queries, and catch a wide variety of common errors. We have also developed a tool for checking correctness of student queries, which can greatly help instructors of database courses.Earlier work in this area focused on checking for serializablity of applications running under weak levels of consistency.For more details, see the home page of the XData project at http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/dbms/xdata.Keyword Search on Databases Soumen Chakrabarti and I lead the BANKS project which aims at supporting keyword queries on structured and semi-structured databases.Earlier work focused on keyword queries on structured data.More recently we have worked on keyword queries on a mix of structured and unstructured data, and on providing more expressive power, while retaining the ability to query data without knowledge of the exact schema or entity indentifiers, by using the Entity-Relationship querying model.
Currently, we are focusing on the above forms of queries, but on data represented using RDF. For more details, see the home page of the BANKS project at http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/banks.Earlier areas include: Main Memory Databases : I was one of the founders of the DataBlitz main memory database project in Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, and also worked on failure recovery error checking and fault tolerance issues, in main memory databases while at Bell Labs.Indexing for Write-Intensive Workloads Deductive Databases: My PhD thesis was on deductive databases, with a focus on query evaluation and semantics for extensions of Datalog with non-stratified negation, aggregation, and non-ground/structured data.
